# SSM
This project aims to help dump and load AWS SSM parameters.


## Usage Example

ssm dump "/app/myapp/app-path"

# All variables described will be inputed inside the IAM configured
ssm load -f ssm.json
```

## Load file format
The file to use the `ssm load` command should be in this format.
```json
{
    "parameters": [
        {
            "Name": "param1",
            "Value": "value1"
        }
    ]
}
```
